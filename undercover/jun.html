        <h3 class="sub_heading">The Beginning: Tokyo</h3>

        <p>Jun Takahashi grew up in the village of Kiryu. From a very young age,
             he was always interested in fashion, enrolling at the Bunka college
              of Fashion in 1988. Punk Rock influence quickly swept Takahashi up
               and inspired him to participate in the Tokyo Sex Pistols, a
               tribute band to the English counterparts. Following this youthful
                inspiration, Takahashi found himself in the small district of
                Urahara.</p>

        <p class="pic_cap">Jun 'Junio' Takahashi (left) and Tomoaki 'Nigo' Nagao
             (right), 1995.</p>

        <p>In 1990, while studying at the Bunka College of Fashion, Takahashi
            met Nigo. Together, they opened up a small boutique called Nowhere.
            The store served as a home for both Takahashi’s Undercover and
            Nigo’s Bape. The first Undercover runway show took place in 1994 in
            Tokyo. For the next several years, Takahashi continued to produce
            seasonal womenswear runway shows in Tokyo with funding from
            maintaining steady business with Nigo at Nowhere.  </p>

        <h3 class="sub_heading">The Paris Spotlight</h3>

        <p>Once an influence for Takahashi, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçon
            began to promote Undercover to her Paris colleagues. Undercover’s
            first show in Paris for <a href="seasons/ss03.html" class="in_link">
            Spring/Summer ’03 “Scab”</a> went on to become arguably the greatest
             Undercover collection to date. With this work, Takahashi was
             propelled into the global fashion spotlight and reached stock lists
              across the globe (Rotman; Li).</p>

        <p>From here on out, Undercover continued to show seasonally in Paris.
            Takahashi’s signature grunge aesthetic and unconventional formats
            continued to evolve for the next several years. As Undercover grew
            in popularity, the streetwear punk influence of Japan evolved into a
             more contemporary style for Takahashi. Modern Undercover continues
             to mix pop-culture streetwear influence with high-end cuts and
             proportions, but as the punk influence has faded away, collections
             have become more accessible and less niche. </p>
